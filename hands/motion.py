"""Human-like pointer system + resting-hand planning (wishlist #24, #28,
#29, #30) — pure, Windows-free, deterministic for a seeded rng.

Everything here PLANS; nothing injects input. muse_relay_hands.py owns
the pyautogui calls, the input mutex instance, the self-input ledger
instance and the resting-hand thread, and feeds them through these planners.
Every random parameter is drawn per call from the rng passed in, so no
two movements share a curve (#24/#28 "never a fixed pattern").
